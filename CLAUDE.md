# CLAUDE.md -- Agent Context for AntSeed Monorepo

## Commit & push policy (IMPORTANT)

**Never commit or push unless explicitly asked.** Default workflow:

1. Make the requested edits.
2. Run typecheck / build / tests to verify the change is sound.
3. **Stop.** Leave changes in the working tree (staged or unstaged). Report
   what you did and wait.

Only commit/push when the user explicitly says so — e.g. "commit", "push",
"/commit", "ship it", "open a PR", or invokes the `commit`, `commit-amos`,
`pr-create`, or `pr-merge` skills.

Rationale: the user batches related edits into a single reviewed commit with
their own message. Auto-committing every tweak produces a noisy history of
one-line commits that has to be squashed later. Do not chain `edit → build
→ commit → push` as a reflex — even if prior turns in the same session did.

## Changelog policy for PRs

When opening a PR, update `CHANGELOG.md` for any user-facing package, CLI,
desktop, protocol, configuration, or documentation behavior change. If a PR has
no user-facing change, say that explicitly in the PR description.

## Project Overview
AntSeed is a peer-to-peer AI services network. Providers offer differentiated
AI services and buyers route requests to the best available peer. This monorepo
contains the core SDK, provider/router plugins, CLI, desktop app, dashboard,
and website.

**Important context for all documentation and code:** AntSeed is NOT for raw
resale of API keys or subscription access. Providers must add value (TEE, skills,
agents, fine-tuned models, managed products). Subscription-based plugins
(provider-claude-code, provider-claude-oauth) are for testing/development only.
Reselling subscription credentials violates upstream provider terms of service.

**AntSeed is not a crypto company.** Settlement happens in USDC on Base, but
buyers are not required to already hold or handle crypto: the desktop app
offers a card checkout (Stripe-backed onramp, region-gated) alongside crypto
funding, and USDC can be funded from an exchange withdrawal, another wallet,
or a card on-ramp (see `apps/website/docs/guides/payments.md`,
`apps/desktop/src/renderer/ui/components/views/VprDepositView.tsx`, and
`apps/cli/README.md`). Never describe AntSeed as crypto-only, wallet-only, or
as requiring the user to already own cryptocurrency.

**When writing marketing or blog content that states a fact about AntSeed**
(pricing, payment flow, CLI behavior, protocol mechanics, what is or isn't
free) — source it only from this repository (code, docs, CHANGELOG) or the
live antseed.com website. Never state an AntSeed-specific fact from general
knowledge, a web search, or inference from silence in a doc (e.g. "the doc
doesn't mention a free tier, so there must not be one" is not a valid basis
for a claim). If a fact can't be verified from those two sources, say so
explicitly rather than asserting it.

  ├── @antseed/provider-core (peer: node)
  │     └── provider-anthropic, provider-claude-code, provider-claude-oauth,
  │         provider-openai, provider-local-llm
  ├── @antseed/router-core (peer: node)

```

## Key Commands
```bash
pnpm install          # Install all dependencies
pnpm run build        # Build all packages in dependency order
pnpm run test         # Run all tests
pnpm run typecheck    # Type-check all packages
pnpm run clean        # Remove all dist/ directories
```

## Nix
`flake.nix` provides a dev shell (`nix develop`) and a buildable CLI package:
`nix build .#` / `nix run .# -- <args>` produces/runs `antseed` from
`apps/cli` (esbuild bundle + pinned native prebuilds for better-sqlite3,
node-datachannel, keytar). The prebuild versions/hashes in `flake.nix` must be
updated when those dependencies change in `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Build Order
Build must respect: node -> provider-core/router-core -> plugins -> dashboard -> cli -> desktop.
The root build script handles this via tiered execution.

## Internal Dependencies
All cross-package references use `workspace:*` protocol in package.json.
Peer dependencies (e.g., @antseed/node) are declared in peerDependencies
and resolved via the workspace.

## Plugin Architecture
- Provider plugins implement the `AntseedProviderPlugin` interface from @antseed/node
- Router plugins implement the `AntseedRouterPlugin` interface from @antseed/node
- Both extend shared infrastructure from provider-core / router-core
- The CLI loads plugins dynamically via the registry in apps/cli/src/plugins/registry.ts

## Smart Contracts
```
packages/contracts/
├── interfaces/              Shared Solidity interfaces (IAntseed*.sol, IERC8004Registry.sol)
├── AntseedRegistry.sol      Central address book for all protocol contracts
├── AntseedStaking.sol       Seller staking (holds stake USDC, binds to agentId)
├── AntseedDeposits.sol      Buyer deposits, seller payouts (holds buyer USDC)
├── AntseedChannels.sol      Payment channel lifecycle, ReserveAuth + SpendingAuth (swappable, holds NO USDC)
├── AntseedEmissions.sol     ANTS token emissions (USDC volume-based)
├── AntseedSlashing.sol      Swappable slashing logic for staked sellers
├── AntseedSubPool.sol       Subscription pool
├── ANTSToken.sol            ANTS ERC-20 token (52M max supply)
├── MockERC8004Registry.sol  Mock ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry (local testing only)
└── MockUSDC.sol             Test USDC
```
Identity uses the deployed ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry (Base: `0x8004A169...`).
Feedback uses the deployed ERC-8004 ReputationRegistry (Base: `0x8004BAa1...`).
All contracts use OpenZeppelin Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20.
Build/test: `cd packages/contracts && forge build && forge test`

### Payment Flow (Cumulative Streaming SpendingAuth)
1. Buyer deposits USDC into AntseedDeposits
2. Buyer signs ReserveAuth(channelId, maxAmount, deadline) off-chain
3. Seller calls `reserve()` on AntseedChannels with buyer's ReserveAuth sig → Deposits.lockForChannel()
4. Per request: buyer signs SpendingAuth(channelId, cumulativeAmount, metadataHash)
5. Seller calls `settle()` or `close()` with latest SpendingAuth → Deposits.chargeAndCreditPayouts()
6. If seller disappears: buyer calls `requestClose()` → `withdraw()` after 15min grace

EIP-712 domain: name="AntseedChannels", version="1"

### Contract Separation Design
- **Stable contracts** (Staking, Deposits) hold funds and rarely change
- **Swappable contract** (Channels) holds no USDC — can be redeployed by re-pointing stable contracts
- Buyer never needs gas — all on-chain actions are seller-initiated or permissionless

## Local Testing (Full Payment Flow)

Prerequisites: `anvil` (from Foundry) and `cast` must be installed.

```bash
# 1. Start local chain
anvil &

# 2. Build everything
pnpm run build

# 3. Deploy contracts + fund wallets + register seller + stake + deposit
./scripts/setup-local-test.sh

# 4. Start seller (in a separate terminal)
node apps/cli/dist/cli/index.js --data-dir ~/.antseed-seller seed \
  --provider openai-responses --verbose --config ~/.antseed-seller/config.json

# 5. Start desktop (in a separate terminal)
cd apps/desktop && npm run dev
```

In the desktop app, go to Settings > Chain Config and set:
- Chain ID: `base-local`
- RPC URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- Deposits: `0x0165878A594ca255338adfa4d48449f69242Eb8F`
- Channels: `0xa513E6E4b8f2a923D98304ec87F64353C4D5C853`

Then start a chat — the payment flow (ReserveAuth → per-request SpendingAuth → settle/close) runs automatically.

## Native Modules
packages/node has native dependencies (better-sqlite3, node-datachannel).
After install, a postinstall script patches ethers type declarations.
The desktop app has a script to rebuild native modules for Electron's Node version.

## SQLite Migrations
Schema changes use a lightweight migration framework in `packages/node/src/storage/`.
```
storage/
  migrate.ts                              # Runner: schema_version table + transactional apply
  migrations/
    channels/                             # payment_channels, payment_receipts
      001_create_tables.ts
      002_add_auth_sig_columns.ts
      index.ts                            # Collects all channel migrations
    metering/                             # metering_events, usage_receipts, sessions, etc.
      001_create_tables.ts
      index.ts                            # Collects all metering migrations
```
To add a new migration: create `NNN_name.ts` exporting `{ migration: Migration }`,
add it to the domain's `index.ts`. Use `/add-migration` skill for scaffolding.
Never modify an existing migration file — always create a new one.

## Model Routing (Levanto integration) — working rules

This fork (branch `model-routing`) is building Levanto's model-routing
subscription on top of AntSeed. Ground truth for this work is:

- `docs/model-routing-architecture-and-open-decisions.md` — design decisions,
  what's locked vs. still open
- `docs/model-routing-software-architecture.md` — code-level architecture
  (client plugin, server plugin, payment mechanics, flows)
- `docs/model-routing-system-architecture.md` — deployed components and what
  talks to what
- `docs/model-routing-payment-flow.md` — the payment mechanism specifically

**Consult these before making any change in this area.** They are the spec,
not a suggestion.

### Public/private split

This repo (`antseed-levanto-router`) is a **public fork** — anyone can read
it. An adjacent, private repo (`levanto-routing-server`, not part of this
monorepo) holds Levanto's proprietary provider-side specifics. Sage itself
lives in its own separate, already-private repo (`sage_model_router`);
`levanto-routing-server` is a different repo, for the routing-server plugin's
own proprietary code plus an end-to-end test harness that installs this fork's
client.

Belongs **here** (public-safe):
- Client-side changes: the `routing-client` plugin, any hooks added to
  existing buyer-proxy/CLI/desktop code, VPR/CLI UI elements
- Wire-level API/schema contracts between client and routing peer (e.g. the
  `/_antseed/route` request/response shape) — the *contract*, not the routing
  peer's internal implementation of it
- Anything that is itself one of the documented public components (software
  architecture doc §1–§2, most of §4)

Must **not** go here — goes in `levanto-routing-server` instead:
- The routing-server plugin's actual proprietary logic (ranking business
  rules, pricing strategy specifics beyond the public wire contract)
- Anything Sage-related beyond "it exists and is called over a local
  interface"
- Any credential, internal cost figure, or competitive detail not already
  stated in the public docs above

**Rule of thumb:** if a change can't be pointed back to a documented,
public-facing component (§1–§4 of the software architecture doc), it
probably doesn't belong in this repo.

### Ground-truth discipline

- Treat the four docs above as authoritative. Don't edit them to match what
  got built — they describe the design, not a changelog of it.
- If implementation needs to deviate from what a doc says, that's fine — but
  log the deviation (what was decided instead, and why) in
  `docs/model-routing-runlog.md`. Don't edit the ground-truth docs to reflect
  it.
- If a design decision comes up that the docs are silent on (an open item, or
  something genuinely unspecified), decide it, implement it, and log it the
  same way, in the runlog.
- Exception: the user may explicitly ask for the ground-truth docs themselves
  to be revised — that's a deliberate editorial act, never something to infer
  from implementation needs.
