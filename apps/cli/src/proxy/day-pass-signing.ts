 * never holds a BuyerPaymentManager or PaymentMux reference directly
 * (software-arch doc SS2.6: that would let plugin code, including
 * third-party routers per SSG3, sign arbitrary messages), so the host
 * builds and owns the actual signing closure and hands it to whichever
 * router requests one via the optional `Router.configureDailySigning`
 * capability.
 *
 * Handles three cases with a single real `BuyerPaymentManager`:
 *  - Bootstrap: no channel with this seller yet -- open one sized to
 *    exactly one day's charge (SS6.3), reserve only, and return. Signing
 *    day 1's real charge is deliberately NOT done here (runlog 2026-09-0X):
 *    it must happen after the seller serves this buyer's first routing
 *    response, same postpaid shape as every later day, not before it. The
 *    seller's day-pass gate flags that first response as owing (a reserved
 *    but never-charged channel), which triggers this function again --
 *    that second call takes the `existingSession` branch below and signs
 *    the real day-1 amount then.
 *  - Ordinary day (also covers day 1's actual signature): sign today's
 *    cumulative; top up for tomorrow if the ceiling is now past its 65%
 *    trigger.
 *  - Reconnect after a toggle-on gap (SS6.7): the ceiling was never
 *    topped up while the buyer was away, so it's raised by exactly one
 *    day's worth (and reconciled from a real on-chain read) BEFORE
 *    signing -- signCumulativeAuth itself never grants more than one
 *    day per call regardless of how long the gap was (see its own doc
 *    comment), so however many days are actually owed get caught up one
 *    per cycle rather than all at once.
